# Project 2: S.P.A.C.E.

## Project Description
S.P.A.C.E. allows users to learn about different OOP programming languages including C# or Java. Users can interact with the deployed Angular SPA to select different concepts of a language along with various code examples, and complete challenges in the built-in sandbox environment. By accessing the different sections the user can learn more about various OOP languages at their own pace and selection of difficulty level. Users can also keep track of their progress, change personal information inside their account management portal, and view personal comments on the various programming topics. Relevent data is stored in an SQLServer database, and accessed by an ASP.NET restfull API hosted on Azue using Entity Framework.
