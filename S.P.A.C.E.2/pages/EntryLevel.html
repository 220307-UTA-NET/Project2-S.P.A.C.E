<h2>if/else and Conditional+Switch statements</h2>

<p>Conditional statements.</p>

<p>C# if else statement is a common selection statement. The if else in C# statement checks a Boolean expression and executes 
    the code based on if the expression is true or false. The if part of the code executes when the value of the 
    expression is true. The else part of the code is executed when the value of the expression is false. The else part 
    of the if..else is optional.</p>

<h2>C# libraries</h2>


<h2>Arrays</h2>

<p>An array stores lists of values in a specific order.</p>
<p>Example: local myArray = {"item1", "item2", 12, Random.Part, myVariable}</p>
<p>In the provided example, all values are inside "{}" and separated by commas.</p>

<h2>Indexes</h2>
<p>Indexers are a syntactic convenience that enable you to create a class, struct, or interface that client 
    applications can access as an array. The compiler will generate an Item property (or an alternatively named property if 
    IndexerNameAttribute is present), and the appropriate accessor methods.
     Indexers are most frequently implemented in types whose primary purpose is to encapsulate an internal collection or array. </p>

<p>An Index can hold multiple values.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you have a class TempRecord that represents the temperature in Fahrenheit as 
    recorded at 10 different times during a 24-hour period. The class contains a temps array of type float[] 
    to store the temperature values. By implementing an indexer in this class, clients can access the temperatures 
    in a TempRecord instance as float temp = tempRecord[4] instead of as float temp = tempRecord.temps[4]. 
    The indexer notation not only simplifies the syntax for client applications; it also makes the class, and its 
    purpose more intuitive for other developers to understand.

    To declare an indexer on a class or struct, use the "this" keyword</p>
