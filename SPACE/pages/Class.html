    <h1>Explain What A Class Is and It's Relation to Objects</h1>

    <h2>Class:</h2>
    <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
    <li>A blueprint from which objects are created.</li>
    <li>Combines the fields and methods into a single unit, but we will get to that later in the tutorial.</li>
    <li>Supports polymorphism, inheritance, and also provide the concept of derived classes and base classes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Declaration of class:</h2>
    <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
        <li>contains only a keyword class, followed by identifier(name) of the class.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example:</h2>
    <xmp>
        public class Programming
        {
            // field variable
            public int a, b;

            // method
            public void display()
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Class & Objects in C#");
            }
        }
    </xmp>

    <h2>Objects:</h2>
    <p>A basic unit of object-oriented programming and represents real-life entities.</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
    <li>State: It is represented by attributes of an object. it also reflects the properties of an object.</li>
    <li>Behavior: It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object with other objects.</li>
    <li>Identity: Gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example: C# Objects</h2>
    <xmp>
        // Dog is an object
        Dog tuffy;
    </xmp>
