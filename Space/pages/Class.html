    <h1>Explain What A Class Is and It's Relation to Objects</h1>

    <h2>Class:</h2>
    <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
    <li>A blueprint from which objects are created.</li>
    <li>Combines the fields and methods into a single unit, but we will get to that later in the tutorial.</li>
    <li>Supports polymorphism, inheritance, and also provide the concept of derived classes and base classes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Declaration of class:</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
        <li>contains only a keyword class, followed by identifier(name) of the class.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
        <code class="language-csharp">
            public class Programming
            {
                // field variable
                public int a, b;

                // method
                public void display()
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("Class & Objects in C#");
                }
            }
        </code>
     </pre>

    <h3>Objects:</h3>
    <p>A basic unit of object-oriented programming and represents real-life entities.</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
    <li>State: It is represented by attributes of an object. it also reflects the properties of an object.</li>
    <li>Behavior: It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object with other objects.</li>
    <li>Identity: Gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example: C# Objects</h3>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
        <code class="lanuage-csharp">
            // Dog is an object
            Dog tuffy;
        </code>
    </pre>
